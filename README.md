## 1. Project Overview

In this project, I'll apply data engineering to analyze disaster data from <a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/" target="_blank">Figure Eight</a> to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

_data_ directory contains a data set which are real messages that were sent during disaster events. I will be creating a machine learning pipeline to categorize these events so that appropriate disaster relief agency can be reached out for help.

This project will include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.

[Here](#eg) are a few screenshots of the web app.

## 2. Project Components

There are three components of this project:

<a id='etl_pipeline'></a>

### 2.1. ETL Pipeline

File _data/process_data.py_ contains data cleaning pipeline that:

- Loads the `messages` and `categories` dataset
- Merges the two datasets
- Cleans the data
- Stores it in a **SQLite database**

<a id='ml_pipeline'></a>

### 2.2. ML Pipeline

File _models/train_classifier.py_ contains machine learning pipeline that:

- Loads data from the **SQLite database**
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs result on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

<a id='flask'></a>

### 2.3. Flask Web App

<a id='eg'></a>

Running [this command](#com) **from app directory** will start the web app where users can enter their query, i.e., a request message sent during a natural disaster, e.g. _"Please, we need tents and water. We are in Silo, Thank you!"_.

**_Screenshot 1_**

What the app will do is that it will classify the text message into categories so that appropriate relief agency can be reached out for help.

## 3. Running

There are three steps to get up and runnning with the web app if you want to start from ETL process.

<a id='cleaning'></a>

### 3.1. Data Cleaning

**Go to the project directory** and the run the following command:

```bat
python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
```

The first two arguments are input data and the third argument is the SQLite Database in which we want to save the cleaned data. The ETL pipeline is in _process_data.py_.

_DisasterResponse.db_ already exists in _data_ folder but the above command will still run and replace the file with same information.

<a id='training'></a>

### 3.2. Training Classifier

After the data cleaning process, run this command **from the project directory**:

```bat
python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
```

This will use cleaned data to train the model, improve the model with grid search and saved the model to a pickle file (_classifer.pkl_).

_classifier.pkl_ already exists but the above command will still run and replace the file will same information.

_**Screenshot 4**_

![train_classifier_1](img/train_classifier_1.jpg)

It took me around **4 minutes** to train the classifier with grid search.

When the models is saved, it will look something like this.

<a id='starting'></a>

### 3.3. Starting the web app

Now that we have cleaned the data and trained our model. Now it's time to see the prediction in a user friendly way.

**Go the app directory** and run the following command:

<a id='com'></a>

```bat
python run.py
```

This will start the web app and will direct you to a URL where you can enter messages and get classification results for it.

<a id='conclusion'></a>

## 4. Conclusion

Some information about training data set as seen on the main page of the web app.

**_Screenshot 7_**

![genre](img/genre.jpg)

**_Screenshot 8_**

![dist](img/dist.jpg)

As we can see the data is highly imbalanced. Though the accuracy metric is [high](#acc) (you will see the exact value after the model is trained by grid search, it is ~0.94), it has a poor value for recall (~0.6). So, take appropriate measures when using this model for decision-making process at a larger scale or in a production environment.

Thanks <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity</a> for letting me use their logo as favicon for this web app.

Another <a href="https://medium.com/udacity/three-awesome-projects-from-udacitys-data-scientist-program-609ff0949bed" target="_blank">blog post</a> was a great motivation to improve my documentation. This post discusses some of the cool projects from <a href="https://in.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025" target="_blank">Data Scientist Nanodegree</a> students. This really shows how far we can go if we apply the concepts learned beyond the classroom content to build something that inspire others.
